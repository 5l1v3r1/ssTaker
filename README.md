# ssTaker



A simple bash Script that takes a file with urls as input.

tries to capture screenshot of it using [cutycapt](http://cutycapt.sourceforge.net/) 
and then generate a simple html report file


#### I wrote this as [EyeWitness](https://github.com/ChrisTruncer/EyeWitness) doesn't work on **parrot os** And I am not a kali fan  



### Usage :
`
./ssTaker.sh urls
`

The urls list file should be without protocol 
That is it should look like this 

``` 
>> cat urls
example.com
yahoo.com
```
