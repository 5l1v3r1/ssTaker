# ssTaker



A simple bash Script that takes a file with urls as input.

tries to capture screenshot of it using [cutycapt](http://cutycapt.sourceforge.net/) 
and then generate a simple html report file


#### I wrote this as [EyeWitness](https://github.com/ChrisTruncer/EyeWitness) doesn't work on **parrot os** And I am not a kali fan  



### Usage :
`
./ssTaker.sh urls
`

This branch contains some experiments that I am trying with this script

Read [Notes](notes.md) for mind proccess regarding this.
