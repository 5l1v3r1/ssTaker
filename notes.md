## Ideas


#### to speedup the process

- to speed up we will divide the urls into different proccesses
- to divide the urls first check if the num of urls are Odd or even
- then divide them into 10 processes
- use `command &` to launch a proceses
- we will use wait command in end to wait for processes to complete
- verify if the cutycapt deals with ssl cert errrors
- urls will contain protocol by itself
- see if we can get a progress bar for it
- Timeout to be consider for each urls
- check number of screenshots live that is continusly
